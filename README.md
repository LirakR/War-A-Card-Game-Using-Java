# War-A-Card-Game-Using-Java
War is a card game that is played with two players. They both deal cards and the one that has the bigger value of the card wins that "war" and the player who loses has to add both cards on his own pile. If the value is the same they deal again and stack cards until someone wins the war and gives all the cards to the loser.
The game is played by shuffeling and spliting the cards in two piles(27 each) and then pressing the "Deal" button.
